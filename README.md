# IRCDCampf

This is a service for EmmanuelOga/ircd_slim IRC server. It allows you to
utilize the campfire chat service using an IRC client.

## How To

IRCDCampf has only been tested with ruby 1.9.2. Clone the repo, then
run:

bin/ircd_campf

Type /list to see the list of available channels.

## TODO

This is an alpha release, handling corner cases might be missing yet.
Also, it has no history handling yet.

You might need to checkout the rest of the gems from sources if I
haven't yet pushed them to rubygems:

* EmmanuelOga/ircd_slim
* EmmanuelOga/irc_parser
